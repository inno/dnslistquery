An event-based scriptable tool designed to (initially) check if an IP is on a blacklist.

While the current list is rather large, feel free to use your own.

Using dl_query.pl in a script:

    #!/bin/bash

    ./dl_query.pl $(hostname -i) > /dev/null

    if [ $? != 0 ]; then
        echo "We have a problem!"
    fi


Using dl_query.pl manually:

    ./dl_query.pl 74.125.113.27 | grep -v '^ok'
